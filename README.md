# My Personal Website ðŸŒŸ

Hey there! Welcome to my personal website project. This is where I showcase who I am, what I do, and share some cool stuff I've been working on.

## What's This All About?

This is my little corner of the internet. I wanted something fast, clean, and easy to maintain, so I went with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It's been a fun project to work on!

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** 
- **TypeScript** 
- **Vite** 
- **Tailwind CSS** 
- **Vue Router** 
- **Vue i18n** 

Feel free to check out the code and see how everything is put together. It's all open source, so you can use it as a starting point for your own projects.
